Welcome to Stream's documentation!
==================================

Stream is a HW architecture-mapping design space exploration (DSE) framework for multi-core
deep learning accelerators. The mapping can be explored at different granularities,
ranging from classical layer-by-layer processing to fine-grained layer-fused processing.
Stream builds on top of the ZigZag DSE framework, found [here](https://zigzag-project.github.io/zigzag/).
