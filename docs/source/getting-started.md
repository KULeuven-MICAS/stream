# Getting Started

## Tutorial

The recommended way to get started with Stream is through the tutorial
labs. You can find them in the `tutorial` branch of the
repository. You should start with lab1
[here](https://github.com/KULeuven-MICAS/stream/tree/tutorial/lab1).

## Manual run

You can also run the main script directly. This will run a genetic
algorithm on the inputs defined in the main file. You can read the file for more details.

``` bash
$ python main_stream_ga.py
```
