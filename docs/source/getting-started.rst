Tutorial
--------

The recommended way to get started with Stream is through the tutorial labs. You can find them in the `tutorial` branch of the repository. You should start with lab1 `here <https://github.com/KULeuven-MICAS/stream/tree/tutorial/lab1>`_.

Manual run
----------

You can also run the main script directly. This will run a genetic algorithm on the inputs defined in the main file.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python main_stream_ga.py
