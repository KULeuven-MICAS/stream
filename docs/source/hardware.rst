Hardware Architecture
=====================

HW Accelerator Model
--------------------

Multiple cores are combined together into the Stream accelerator object.

The Stream accelerator definition includes:

* **name**: A user-defined name for the accelerator.
* **cores**: A list of cores, each defined in a .yaml file. Absolute or relative paths are allowed. The standard path assumed is "./cores/".
* **graph**: Definition of the core interconnection topology.

Graph Definition
----------------

The graph definition determines the core interconnection topology. Currently, two topologies are supported: '2d-mesh' and 'bus'.

The '2d-mesh' topology is defined through the following fields:

* **type**: The type of the graph, which should be '2d-mesh'.
* **nb_rows**: The number of rows in the 2D mesh.
* **nb_cols**: The number of columns in the 2D mesh.
* **bandwidth**: The bandwidth of each created directional link in bits per clock cycle.
* **unit_energy_cost**: The unit energy cost of having a communication-link active. This does not include the involved memory read/writes.
* **pooling_core_id**: If provided, the pooling core id. A link is added between the pooling core and each compute core in the mesh.
* **simd_core_id**: If provided, the simd core id. A link is added between the simd core and each compute core in the mesh.
* **offchip_core_id**: If provided, the offchip core id. A link is added between the offchip core and each compute core in the mesh.

The 'bus' topology is defined through the following fields:

* **type**: The type of the graph, which should be 'bus'.
* **bandwidth**: The bandwidth of the bus in bits per clock cycle.
* **unit_energy_cost**: The unit energy cost of having a communication-link active. This does not include the involved memory read/writes.
* **pooling_core_id**: If provided, the pooling core id. A link is added between the pooling core and each compute core in the mesh.
* **simd_core_id**: If provided, the simd core id. A link is added between the simd core and each compute core in the mesh.
* **offchip_core_id**: If provided, the offchip core id. A link is added between the offchip core and each compute core in the mesh.
